/**
 * ## Window Tracking
 *
 * ### Goal
 *
 * We want a list of all windows known to the window manager and to keep that
 * up-to-date and to reflect those changes to the server as they happen, using
 * identifiers that are stable for the duration of the X session.
 *
 * This enables the server to automatically re-establish bookmarks based on
 * information about the windows, etc.
 *
 * ### Mechanism
 *
 * Moderate investigation shows that there are two means of tracking windows
 * in an entirely window-driven manner using signals.
 *
 * - Workspaces.  They eached provide "window-added"/"window-removed" signals
 *   that originate from within the C core of Mutter.  The downside to this is
 *   some windows exist across all workspaces and the set of workspaces can
 *   dynamically change, so there's some additional bookkeeping and moving
 *   parts.
 *   - This is what shell-window-tracker.c uses to find out about windows.  It
 *     helps map from windows to ShellApp instances which can also provide us
 *     with PIDs.
 * - Use the display-scoped "window-created" signal, then subscribe to the
 *   "unmanaged" signal on each of the created windows to know when they go
 *   away.  This potentially results in a much greater number of tracked
 *   signals.
 *
 * The JS logic in gnome-shell seems to frequently favor dirtying notifications
 * that cause a re-enumeration of the known windows/workspaces/etc. using either
 * delta detection or just re-starting from an empty state.  This fits well in
 * many cases that are triggered by user action, but doesn't fit for us.
 *
 * The currently adopted solution is the 1 "window-created" listener paired with
 * N "unmanaged" listeners.
